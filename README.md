### List of data models

The following entity types are available:
- [AgriApp](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Agrifood/blob/master/AgriApp/README.md). This entity contains a harmonised description of a generic app made for the Agrifood domain. This entity is primarily associated with the agricultural vertical and related IoT applications.

- [AgriCrop](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Agrifood/blob/master/AgriCrop/README.md). This entity contains a harmonised description of a generic crop. This entity is primarily associated with the agricultural vertical and related IoT applications.

- [AgriFarm](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Agrifood/blob/master/AgriFarm/README.md). This entity contains a harmonised description of a generic farm made up of buildings and parcels. This entity is primarily associated with the agricultural vertical and related IoT applications.

- [AgriFertilize](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Agrifood/blob/master/AgriFertilize/README.md). Schema for AgriFertilize entity. To fertilize land means to improve its quality in order to make plants grow well on it, by spreading solid animal waste or a chemical mixture on it

- [AgriGreenhouse](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Agrifood/blob/master/AgriGreenhouse/README.md). This entity contains a harmonised description of the conditions recorded within a generic greenhouse, a type of AgriParcel.

- [AgriParcel](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Agrifood/blob/master/AgriParcel/README.md). This entity contains a harmonised description of a generic parcel of land. This entity is primarily associated with the agricultural vertical and related IoT applications.

- [AgriParcelOperation](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Agrifood/blob/master/AgriParcelOperation/README.md). This entity contains a harmonised description of a generic operations performed on a parcel of land. This entity is primarily associated with the agricultural vertical and related IoT applications.

- [AgriParcelRecord](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Agrifood/blob/master/AgriParcelRecord/README.md). This entity contains a harmonised description of the conditions recorded on a parcel of land. This entity is primarily associated with the agricultural vertical and related IoT applications.

- [AgriPest](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Agrifood/blob/master/AgriPest/README.md). This entity contains a harmonised description of an agricultural pest. 

- [AgriPhytosanitary](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Agrifood/blob/master/AgriPhytosanitary/README.md). Schema for AgriPhytosanitary entity. Phytosanitary means relating to the health of plants

- [AgriProductType](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Agrifood/blob/master/AgriProductType/README.md). This entity contains a harmonised description of a generic agricultural product type. This entity is primarily associated with the agricultural vertical and related IoT applications. The AgriProductType includes a hierarchical structure that allows product types to be grouped in a flexible way.

- [AgriSoil](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Agrifood/blob/master/AgriSoil/README.md). This entity contains a harmonised description of a generic soil. This entity is primarily associated with the agricultural vertical and related IoT applications.

- [Animal](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Agrifood/blob/master/Animal/README.md). An observation of animal conditions at a certain place and time. This data model has been developed for the IoF2020 UC ShareBeef by UCO and SensoWave.

- [AnimalDisease](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Agrifood/blob/master/AnimalDisease/README.md). Object modelling an animal disease for a livestock farm.

- [AnimalMovement](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Agrifood/blob/master/AnimalMovement/README.md). Object modelling of an animal movement for a livestock farm.

- [Carcass](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Agrifood/blob/master/Carcass/README.md). Object modelling a carcass of an animal for a livestock farm.

- [Compartment](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Agrifood/blob/master/Compartment/README.md). Artificial area in a building or department that is measured by certain sensors. A compartment is not necessarily a physical separator. It can be a department or a grouping of several pens within a department that are being measured by the same sensor.

- [FeedRegistry](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Agrifood/blob/master/FeedRegistry/README.md). Object modelling a feed registry for a livestock farm.

- [MeatProduct](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Agrifood/blob/master/MeatProduct/README.md). Object modelling a meat product for a livestock farm.

- [Pen](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Agrifood/blob/master/Pen/README.md). Fenced area in a building or department or outside housing a group of animals. Animals in a pen can move and interact freely. Pens are often not completely separated from each other (half walls, iron bars, fences,â€¦), making it possible that animals from neighbouring pens can see/touch

- [VeterinarianTreatment](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Agrifood/blob/master/VeterinarianTreatment/README.md). Object modelling a veterinary treatment for a livestock farm.
